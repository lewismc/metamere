# orbital
A Python toolkit providing utility ortibal mechanics functions and calculations relevant to remote sensing.

## Introduction
The Orbital toolkit is an effort to develop something useful to help myself and others engaged in the study of 
the Physics of Remote Sensing as taught by [Dr. Jakob van Zyl](http://www.jpl.nasa.gov/about/bio_zyl.php) 
in his [EE/Ae 157 Introduction to the Physics of Remote Sensing course](http://www.its.caltech.edu/~ee157/) 
at the California Institute of Technology in Pasadena, CA, U.S.A. I had the pleasure of taking this class throughout
2016 and into 2017.

This course provides an overview of the physics behind space remote sensing instruments. 
Topics include the interaction of electromagnetic waves with natural surfaces, including scattering of microwaves, 
microwave and thermal emission from atmospheres and surfaces, and spectral reflection from natural surfaces and 
atmospheres in the near-infrared and visible regions of the spectrum. 

The class also discusses the design of modern space sensors and associated technology, including sensor design, 
new observation techniques, ongoing developments, and data analysis and interpretation. Examples of applications 
and instrumentation cover geology, planetology, oceanography, astronomy, and atmospheric research.

Orbital will provide a mechanism to programmatically execute all calculations as covered within the course.

## Installation
Make sure you have Python installed and run from the Cheeseshop
```
$ pip install orbital
```
alternatively you can install from source
```
$ git clone https://github.com/lewismc/orbital.git
$ cd orbital && python setup.py install
```
